# The Trials of Elementa

## Game Description

 The Trials of Elementa is a 2D turn-based magic combat game set in a fantasy academy where players must battle rival elemental clubs to unlock a forbidden spell. The player takes the role of a young mage in a club with no memory, who must defeat other three elemental clubs: Fire, Water, Earth, or Air and unlock the ancient spell Arcanocide to face the final evil, Voidwalker. The game emphasizes strategic spell use, retry mechanics, and story-based progression.

## Features
- Duel System:
Turn-based 1 vs 1 battles with club representatives to get the spell. Strategic options like attack, defend, and special spell use.

- Retry Mechanism:
Players get two extra chances per club if they lose a duel.

- Spell Unlocking:
Winning each duel helps winning a spell. Collecting all three unlocks Arcanocide.

- Final Boss Battle:
A final duel with the Voidwalker using the full power of Arcanocide.
